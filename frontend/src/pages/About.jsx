          <h3 className="font-bold">Our Story</h3>
          <p>
            Animal Care was founded in 2020 by a group of passionate animal
            lovers who wanted to make a difference in the lives of pets and
            their owners. What started as a small rescue operation has grown
            into a comprehensive resource for pet care, adoption, and education.
            Our team is made up of experienced veterinarians, animal
            behaviorists, and volunteers who share a common goal: to improve the
            welfare of animals everywhere.

              with the right family.

            <li>
              Educational Resources: We provide valuable information on pet
              care, training, and health to help pet owners give their
              companions the best life possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Community Outreach: We work with local shelters, veterinary
              clinics, and animal welfare organizations to promote responsible
              pet ownership and support animal welfare initiatives.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rescue and Rehabilitation: Our team rescues animals in need and
              provides them with medical care, rehabilitation, and love until
              they are ready for adoption.
